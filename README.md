# Smart_Hospital
1.	 Project Description:-
•	Currently We know that the Health is one of the biggest factor for each and every Human.  Humans are not interested to go to the Hospital because they don't believe the Current imperfect Management of Hospital . So I had made this project for Changing the Mindset of Humans towards Hospital  Management by implementing the Automation in it So that they will trust the Computer not the Human. And also the System will become Fast and Secure and Easy to Use.

•	Because Earlier they are Using Paper Work For Registration and all other Stuff in Hospital. But Nowdays Everthing is becoming Automize. Not Also Hospital Management but also all other system are becoming Automize for its Easy to Learn Approach and Easy to implement Approach.
